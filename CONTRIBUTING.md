<h1>Want to contribute!?</h1>
Everyone feel free to make changes and submit a pull request, once I ensure that the code is funtional I will merge it into the project!

<h2>How can I test?</h2>
To test the code yourself, I would recomend going to https://discord.com/developers/ and following these steps:

1. Creating an application
2. Creating a bot
3. Copy the token for the bot
4. create a constants.py file
5. create a discord_token variable in constants.py and paste the coppied token as a string
6. Create a test server and invite your bot to that server, you will find invite options in https://discord.com/developers/

Now you should be able to test the functionality of the bot.
